 ### 1.0  [How to Set up Email Server in Rust Programming Language](https://opeolluwa.hashnode.dev/how-to-set-up-email-server-in-rust)

 In this post I exemplified how to set up an email server in Rust programming language. The code for this post can be found [here](./rust-axum-email-server/). It is written in Rust using the [lettre](https://crates.io/crates/lettre) crate, and the [Axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum) web framework. The code is a simple email server that listens on `localhost:3000` and sends an email to the recipient specified in the request body. The email server uses the `lettre` crate to send emails and the `Axum` crate to handle incoming HTTP requests.

The blog post exemplified several use cases of Regex, this include:

1. Email Validation 
2. Password Strength Validation
3. URL Validation
4. Enforcing Date Format
5. Nigerian Phone Number Validation

### 3.0  [Beginning Kafka and Node.js](https://medium.com/devops-dev/beginning-kafka-and-nodejs-7eb23c0c744e)

In this post, I discussed how to set up a Kafka cluster and how to produce and consume messages from the cluster using Node.js. The code for this post can be found [here](./kafka-nodejs/). it is written in JavaScript for brevity.
